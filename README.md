# Learn Local
A new Coderplex initiative to create learning resources for modern technologies, but in the local languages of India. Our mission is to improve the state of tech in India, and part of that mission is to remove whatever obstacles are in place preventing people from learning and improving themselves. We have realized over time that, the language used in every single resource available i.e. English, be it in video or text format, is a significant obstacle preventing masses of people in the country from learning efficiently and progressing in their lives.

Through this initiative, we want to collaborate with teachers who are proficient in the various local languages of India, to create learning resources (video + text) that cover as many modern technologies as possible.

## Technologies and Domains
`Web Development`, `Mobile Development`, `Computer Science`, `Data Science`, `Artificial Intelligence`, `Information Security`, `Programming Languages`, `Decentralization`, `Internet of Things`

Please send a PR to add or edit the above list

## Languages
`Hindi`, `Telugu`, `Tamil`, `Urdu`, `Bengali`, `Marathi`, `Kannada`, `Gujarati`, `Odia`, `Malayalam`

### How to Contribute
You can start by creating a [new issue](https://github.com/coderplex/learn-local/issues/new) for a learning resource that you would like to create or think should be created for a perticular domain or technology in a perticular local language. We can have a discussion on the topic, and move ahead from there
