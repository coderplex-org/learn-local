# Learn Local
A new Coderplex initiative to create learning resources for modern technologies, but in the local languages of India. Our mission is to improve the state of tech in India, and part of that mission is to remove whatever obsticles are in place preventing people from learning and improving themselves. We have realized over time that, the language used in every single resource avaiable i.e. English, be it in video or text format, is a significant obsticle priventing masses of people in the country from learning efficiently and progressing in their lives. 

Through this initiative, we want to collaborate with teachers who are profficient in the various local languages of India, to create learning resources (video + text) that cover as many modern technologies as possible.
